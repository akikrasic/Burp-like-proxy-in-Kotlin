In package  srb.akikrasic.sertifikat.sertifikatzabrowser there is a aCertCa.p12 key which should be added into browser before running the app. In method ucitavanjeCa in file sertifikatNovi.kt in srb.akikrasic.sertifikat package, you should change 39.th line with the path of that aCertCa.p12 file on your local machine( i will fix it in the future, of course). Than you put your browser to listen to proxy on localhost:8080 and you start the server. You should have Java 21 on your machine. Many things will be added in the future, i am still working.
